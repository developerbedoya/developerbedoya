## Hi 👋

I’m [@developerbedoya][homepage], a Software Developer and hobbyist in astronomy and drawing.

- 👀 I’m interested in programming (including, but no limited to: C, C++, C#, Python, Javascript, TypeScript and Dart)
- 🌱 I’m currently revisiting a [course on ASP.NET Core and Angular](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch), making a [course on Emacs](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-to-work-with-emacs).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cross-platform software development, for fun.
